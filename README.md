# WEB103 Prework - *👉🏿 Advanced Web Development (WEB103)*

Submitted by: **👉🏿 Jonathan Tavarez**

About this web app: **👉🏿 Creatorverse is a web application developed as part of the prework for CodePath's Advanced Web Development (WEB103) course. This project focuses on building a React frontend that interacts with an API to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on a list of content creators. The application allows users to manage their favorite creators, whether they are Twitch streamers, YouTube channels, Instagram personalities, TikTok accounts, or others.**

Time spent: **👉🏿 15** hours
